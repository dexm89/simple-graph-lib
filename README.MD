Simple Graph lib: 
 
Should support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations: 
 
 addVertex - adds vertex to the graph 
 
 addEdge - adds edge to the graph 
 
 getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesn’t have to be optimal) 
 
 Vertices should be of a user defined type. 
  
Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph. 
 
Make you graphs thread safe.
